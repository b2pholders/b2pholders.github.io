            <p class="card-text">
                We maintain this page to demonstrate our firm commitment to the rights and privacy of our users. This page explains how our site collects information from our members.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">Free Newsletter and Mailing List</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                We respect the privacy of our users, and as such we will never share our database of email addresses and names with any third party.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Upon confirmation that you would like to join our newsletter, we will from time to time send you free information relating to the products we market, general advice related to online marketing, and promotional material for other products. Your email will never be passed onto any third party. We will also never spam you. You may unsubscribe from the mailing list at any time.

            <h5 class="section-title">Personal Information We Collect and How It Is Used</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                <strong>Service Provider:</strong> When you purchase The software, the payment is processed by Clicksure.com, who will collect your name, address, and credit card information to verify your order. They may not use the information for any other purpose. Upon ordering, we also collect your name and e-mail address. We use this information to follow-up on you as per the above newsletter section.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">Earnings Disclaimer</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Every effort has been made to accurately represent this product and its potential. Even though this industry is one of the few where one can write their own check in terms of earnings, there is no guarantee that you will earn any money using the techniques and ideas in these materials.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Examples in these materials are not to be taken as a promise or guarantee of earnings. Earning potential is entirely dependent on the person using our product, ideas, techniques and the effort put forth. We do not purport this as a "get rich scheme", and nor should you view it as such.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Any and all forward-looking statements here or on any of our sales material are intended to express our opinion of earnings potential. Many factors will be important in determining your actual results and no guarantees are made that you will achieve results similar to ours or anybody else’s, in fact no guarantees are made that you will achieve any results from our ideas and techniques.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Results vary, and as with any money-making opportunity, you could make more or less. Success in ANY money-making opportunity is a result of hard work, time, and a variety of other factors. No express or implied guarantees of income are made by The software.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">Returns and Refunds Policy</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                As stated, if you purchase The software, and you do not enjoy the financial freedom that you expected, do not make as much from our methods as you expected, or indeed for any reason, you may claim a refund for the product within 60 days of purchase. On a side note, we do ask you to put the techniques into use before requesting a refund, for both our benefit; however, our refund policy is unconditional and this is a suggestion, not a requirement. We are aware that some buyers will not achieve their personal goals despite our best efforts to the contrary, and we stand by our refund policy as such. Please forward your receipt number (given to you when you ordered) to us and we will action your refund request as quickly as possible, typically within 24 hours.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">Collection of Information</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                The Software respects the privacy of every individual who visits our websites. This privacy statement provides notice of the standards and terms under which The Software protects the privacy of information supplied by visitors to sites on the World Wide Web that are owned and operated by The Software, including The Software and The Software. This privacy statement provides notice of our information collection practices and of the ways in which your information may be used. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to review this information.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">A. Personally-Identifiable Information</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                The Software typically receives specific data about its website visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for services, open a customer support inquiry ticket, provide resume information for employment opportunities, or send us an email. Of course, some of these activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a purchase, use a credit card to pay for services, submit your resume, or request certain types of information. When you provide personally-identifiable information to The Software through one of our websites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. In most cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do, or do not, want The Software to use this information for additional purposes. You may also request that The Software not use your information by sending an email to: support@fxrevenge.net. However, The Software reserves the right, in its discretion, to send you bulletins and other important information about your The Software services. Absent any instructions from you, The Software may use information you provide to inform you about additional services and products offered by The Software family of companies, The Software authorized agents, and other goods and services providers with whom The Software has relationships and whose offerings might be of interest to you. The Software will not, however, sell or trade your personally-identifiable information unless we are authorized or legally required to do so, or in the case of imminent physical harm to the visitor or others. On those The Software sites where you may provide The Software with credit card or other ordering information via the web, The Software protects and secures this information by employing commercially customary web-based security and encryption protocols, examples of which include Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET). On those sites where you voluntarily offer any feedback, data, answers, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, or the like, The Software will treat that portion of the information as non-confidential and nonproprietary and, except as otherwise expressed in this privacy statement, The Software assumes no obligation to protect such information from disclosure.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">B. Non Personally-Identifiable (Generic) Information</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                In general, The Software gathers some generic information automatically. Generic information does not reveal the identity of the visitor. It usually includes information about the Internet address assigned to your computer, the number and frequency of visitors, and the The Software sites visited. The Software gathers this information for the limited purpose of determining customer service and website needs. We accomplish this by using certain technologies, including "cookies" (a technology that can be used to provide the visitor with tailored information about The Software services). The Software does not combine information collected in this way with any personally-identifiable information. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and you can refuse it.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">C. Your The Software Hosted Website, Server, Bulletin Boards, Forum, Third-Party Sites</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Information that you disclose in a public space, including on any bulletin board, chat room, or website The Software may host for you as part of your The Software services, is available to anyone else who visits that space. The Software cannot safeguard any information you disclose in these locations. Additionally, The Software websites contain links to sites that belong to third parties unrelated to The Software. The Software cannot protect any information you may disclose in these sites and recommends that you review the privacy policy statements of those sites you visit.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">Third-Party Websites</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                The Software websites may contain links to third-party websites. If you visit these websites, The Software’s privacy policies are no longer in effect. The Software does not share your information with these websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. Please review the privacy policies of any such websites that you visit to understand how they collect, use, and disclose information.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">Data Security</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                The Software implements reasonable precautions to protect the personal information The Software collects from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security. The Software encourages you to take your own steps to protect your information while using the internet, such as using strong passwords and maintaining the privacy of your login credentials.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">Data Retention</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                The Software will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. The Software will also retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if The Software is required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements and policies.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">Children's Privacy</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                The Software’s services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and The Software does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided The Software with personal information, please contact The Software immediately. If The Software becomes aware that The Software has collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, The Software will take steps to remove that information from our servers.
            </p>

            <h5 class="section-title">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                The Software may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. The Software will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. The Software will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our services, prior to the change becoming effective and update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
